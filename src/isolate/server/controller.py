        #  3. [controller]: Await *at most* max_wait_timeout seconds for the agent to be available
        #                   if it doesn't do it until then, raise an AgentError.
        #  4. [controller]: If the server is available, then establish the bridge and pass the
        #                   'function' as the input.
        #  5.      [agent]: Receive the function, deserialize it, start the execution.
        #  6. [controller]: Watch agent for logs (stdout/stderr), and as soon as they appear
        #                   call the log handler.
        #  7.      [agent]: Once the execution of the function is finished, send the result
        #                   using the same serialization method.
        #  8. [controller]: Receive the result back and return it.
